## VAE Architecture 1

Let $y_k$ be measurements of a data generating process. I would like to use the Variational Autoencoder method of statistical inference, to learn about the data generating process. Describe the details of the VAE to accomplish this.

**Answer**

Below is a self-contained description of how to set up and train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to infer the data-generating process behind measurements \(y_k\).  All formulas are in standard LaTeX.

1 **Model specification**
   We introduce a low-dimensional latent variable \(z\in\mathbb R^d\).  The generative model (decoder) and the inference model (encoder) are

\[
     \text{Prior:}\quad p(z)=\mathcal N\bigl(z;0,I\bigr),
     \quad
     \text{Likelihood:}\quad p_\theta(y\mid z),
\]

\[
     \text{Approx.\ posterior:}\quad
     q_\phi(z\mid y)
     =\mathcal N\bigl(z;\,\mu_\phi(y),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\phi^2(y))\bigr).
\]

   Here \(\theta\) are the parameters of the decoder network (which outputs parameters of \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\)), and \(\phi\) are the parameters of the encoder network (which outputs \(\mu_\phi(y)\) and \(\sigma_\phi(y)\)).

2 **Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO)**
   For a single datum \(y\), the marginal log-likelihood \(\log p_\theta(y)\) is intractable.  We instead maximize the ELBO

\[
     \mathcal L(\theta,\phi\,;\,y)
     \;=\;
     \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log p_\theta(y\mid z)\bigr]
     \;-\;
     D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y)\;\|\;p(z)\bigr),
\]

   which satisfies \(\log p_\theta(y)\ge\mathcal L(\theta,\phi;y)\).  Over a dataset \(\{y_k\}_{k=1}^N\) we maximize

\[
     \mathcal L_{\rm total}(\theta,\phi)
     = \sum_{k=1}^N \mathcal L(\theta,\phi\,;\,y_k).
\]

3 **Reparameterization trick**
   To backpropagate through the stochastic sampling \(z\sim q_\phi(z\mid y)\), we write

\[
     z \;=\;\mu_\phi(y)\;+\;\sigma_\phi(y)\odot\epsilon,
     \quad
     \epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I).
\]

   Then

\[
     \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log p_\theta(y\mid z)\bigr]
     \;=\;
     \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I)}
     \bigl[\log p_\theta\bigl(y\mid \mu_\phi(y)+\sigma_\phi(y)\odot\epsilon\bigr)\bigr],
\]

   which can be unbiasedly estimated with Monte Carlo and differentiated w.r.t.\ \(\phi\).

4 **KL-divergence term**
   For two Gaussians \(q=\mathcal N(\mu,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2))\) and \(p=\mathcal N(0,I)\),

\[
     D_{\rm KL}\bigl(q\|p\bigr)
     =\frac12\sum_{i=1}^d
       \bigl[
         \sigma_i^2+\mu_i^2-1-\log(\sigma_i^2)
       \bigr].
\]

5 **Overall training algorithm**
   Use mini-batches \(\{y^{(b)}\}\).  For each batch:
   a) Encode: compute \(\mu_\phi(y^{(b)})\), \(\sigma_\phi(y^{(b)})\).  
   b) Sample \(\epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I)\), form \(z=\mu_\phi+\sigma_\phi\odot\epsilon\).  
   c) Decode: compute \(\log p_\theta(y^{(b)}\mid z)\).  
   d) Compute batch ELBO 

\[
        \mathcal L_{\rm batch}
         =\frac1B\sum_{i=1}^B
          \Bigl[\log p_\theta(y^{(i)}\!\mid z^{(i)})
            -D_{\rm KL}(q_\phi(z^{(i)}\mid y^{(i)})\|p(z))\Bigr].
\]

   e) Take gradient \(\nabla_{\theta,\phi}\mathcal L_{\rm batch}\) (e.g.\ via Adam) and update \(\theta,\phi\).

6 **Choice of decoders**
   – For real-valued \(y\): use Gaussian likelihood  
     \(\;p_\theta(y\mid z)=\mathcal N(y;\,\mu_\theta(z),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_y^2))\).  
   – For binary \(y\): use Bernoulli  
     \(\;p_\theta(y\mid z)=\mathrm{Bernoulli}(y;\,\pi_\theta(z)).\)

7 **Inference about the data-generating process**
   After training, the decoder \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\) and the aggregated posterior give you a generative model of the data.  You can  
   • Sample new synthetic observations \(y\sim p_\theta(y\mid z)\) by first drawing \(z\sim p(z)\).  
   • Approximate the latent representation of any \(y\) by \(q_\phi(z\mid y)\).  
   • Inspect learned features by varying individual components of \(z\) and decoding.

This completes the detailed VAE setup for learning the underlying data-generating process from measurements \(y_k\).

## VAE Architecture 2 - Encoder

Let’s make the setting more precise: the measurements $y_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and the index $k$. Let $Y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the random variable (vector) and the $y_k$ are the observations or realizations of it. 

The encoder takes as input the $y_k$  and models a probability distribution $q_{\phi}(z | y)$. Thus, for each $(k, y_k)$, the encoder introduces a $z_k$. Is this understanding correct so far?

**Answer**

Yes—your understanding is exactly right.  In a VAE we introduce for each observation \(y_k\) a corresponding latent variable \(z_k\), and the encoder network “amortizes” inference by outputting an approximate posterior over \(z\) given \(y\).  Concretely, one usually chooses

\[
q_{\phi}(z\mid y)
=\mathcal N\bigl(z;\,\mu_{\phi}(y),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{\phi}^2(y))\bigr),
\]

so that for each data point \(y_k\) you have

\[
q_{\phi}(z\mid y_k)
=\mathcal N\bigl(z;\,\mu_{\phi}(y_k),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{\phi}^2(y_k))\bigr).
\]

During training (and inference) you then draw

\[
z_k \;=\;\mu_{\phi}(y_k)\;+\;\sigma_{\phi}(y_k)\odot\epsilon_k,
\qquad
\epsilon_k\sim\mathcal N(0,I),
\]

and pass \(z_k\) into the decoder \(p_{\theta}(y\mid z)\).  Thus each \((k,y_k)\) is associated with its own latent \(z_k\), but the map \(y\mapsto(\mu_{\phi}(y),\sigma_{\phi}(y))\) is shared across all \(k\).

## VAE Architecture 3 - Encoder (contd)

The encoder map $y \mapsto (\mu_{\phi}(y), \sigma_{\phi}(y))$ is modeled as a neural network which takes as input the $y$ and outputs $(\mu_{\phi}(y), \sigma_{\phi}(y))$ which are the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution. So in fact, for each $y_k$, there is a unique Gaussian distribution from which the corresponding $z_k$ is drawn. Is this correct?

**Answer**

Yes.  Concretely, the encoder is a deterministic function  

\[
y\;\mapsto\;\bigl(\mu_\phi(y),\,\sigma_\phi(y)\bigr)\in\mathbb R^d\times\mathbb R^d_{>0},
\]  

so that for each observation \(y_k\) you obtain parameters of a Gaussian,  

\[
q_\phi(z\mid y_k)
=\mathcal N\bigl(z;\,\mu_\phi(y_k),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\phi(y_k)^2)\bigr).
\]  

You then draw  

\[
z_k \;=\;\mu_\phi(y_k)\;+\;\sigma_\phi(y_k)\odot\epsilon_k,
\quad
\epsilon_k\sim\mathcal N(0,I),
\]  

so indeed each \(y_k\) induces its own Gaussian from which \(z_k\) is sampled.

## Sampling the latent variable $z$: Reparameterization trick

It would seem that sampling $z_k$ from the Gaussian directly, that is $ z_k \sim \mathcal{N}(z; \mu_{\phi}(y_k), diag(\sigma_{\phi}(y_k)^2))$ is more natural than in the manner you describe.

**Answer**

Your intuition is absolutely right: in the VAE we do want to “really” draw  

\[
z_k \;\sim\;\mathcal N\!\bigl(\mu_{\phi}(y_k)\,,\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{\phi}(y_k)^2)\bigr)
\]

for each data‐point \(y_k\).  The reason we write it in the form

\[
z_k \;=\;\mu_{\phi}(y_k)\;+\;\sigma_{\phi}(y_k)\odot\epsilon_k,
\quad
\epsilon_k\sim\mathcal N(0,I)
\]

is simply a _reparameterization_ of that same Gaussian draw.  Algebraically the two are equivalent.  The reparameterization is introduced only so that when you back‐propagate the reconstruction‐loss 

\[
\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\bigr]
\]

through the encoder network, you get low‐variance, unbiased gradients w.r.t.\ \(\phi\).  

If you were to write  

\[
z_k \;\sim\;\mathcal N\bigl(\mu_{\phi}(y_k),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{\phi}(y_k)^2)\bigr)
\]

and then try to differentiate directly through that sampling operation, the path from \(\phi\) into the sample \(z_k\) would be _discontinuous_ and you would have to resort to score‐function estimators (REINFORCE), which typically have much higher variance.

Thus:  
1  Yes, each \(y_k\) defines its own Gaussian for \(z_k\).  
2  Writing the draw via  

\[
     z_k = \mu_\phi(y_k) + \sigma_\phi(y_k)\odot\epsilon_k
\]

   is just a mathematically equivalent way of expressing  

\[
     z_k\sim\mathcal N\bigl(\mu_\phi(y_k),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\phi(y_k)^2)\bigr)
\]

   that makes it possible to back‐propagate gradients through the random draw.

## Reparameterization Trick 2

Show the mathematical equivalence of the two ways of drawing $z_k$ rigorously.

**Answer**

Below is a standard “change‐of‐variables” proof (using the Jacobian) and an alternative proof via moment‐generating functions, which together show rigorously that

$$
z=\mu+\sigma\odot\epsilon,\quad\epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I_d)
$$

has exactly the same law as

$$
z\sim\mathcal N\bigl(\mu,\;\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2)\bigr).
$$

1  **Change‐of‐variables (Jacobian) proof**
   Let \(d\) be the dimension of \(z\).  Write \(\sigma=(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_d)\) and define the diagonal matrix

   $$
     \Sigma=\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_d)\in\mathbb R^{d\times d}.
   $$

   We draw

   $$
     \epsilon\sim p_\epsilon(\epsilon)
     =\frac1{(2\pi)^{d/2}}
       \exp\!\Bigl(-\tfrac12\,\epsilon^\top\epsilon\Bigr),
     \qquad
     z \;=\;\mu+\Sigma\,\epsilon.
   $$

   Since the map

   $$
     T:\;\epsilon\mapsto z=T(\epsilon)=\mu+\Sigma\,\epsilon
   $$

   is invertible with

   $$
     T^{-1}(z)=\Sigma^{-1}(z-\mu),
     \quad
     \det\Bigl(\tfrac{\partial T^{-1}}{\partial z}\Bigr)
     =\det(\Sigma^{-1})
     =\prod_{i=1}^d\frac1{\sigma_i}\,,
   $$

   the density of \(z\) is

\[
     p_z(z)      =p_\epsilon\bigl(T^{-1}(z)\bigr)
      \;\Bigl|\det\bigl(\tfrac{\partial T^{-1}}{\partial z}\bigr)\Bigr|
     =\frac1{(2\pi)^{d/2}}
      \exp\!\Bigl(-\tfrac12\|\Sigma^{-1}(z-\mu)\|^2\Bigr)
      \;\prod_{i=1}^d\frac1{\sigma_i}.
\]

   Noting 
   \(\|\Sigma^{-1}(z-\mu)\|^2=\sum_i\frac{(z_i-\mu_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}\)
   and \(\prod_i\sigma_i^{-1}=(\det\Sigma)^{-1}\), this becomes

   $$
     p_z(z)
     =\frac1{(2\pi)^{d/2}\,\prod_i\sigma_i}
      \exp\!\Bigl(-\tfrac12\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{(z_i-\mu_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}\Bigr),
   $$

   which is _exactly_ the density of \(\mathcal N(\mu,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2))\).

2  **Moment‐Generating‐Function (MGF) proof**
   Recall the MGF of a random vector \(w\) is \(M_w(t)=\mathbb E[e^{t^\top w}]\).  If \(w\sim\mathcal N(0,I)\), then \(M_w(t)=\exp(\tfrac12\,t^\top t)\).  Now set

   $$
     z=\mu+\Sigma\,\epsilon,
     \quad
     \epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I).
   $$

   Then for any \(t\in\mathbb R^d\),

\[
     M_z(t)
     =\mathbb E\bigl[e^{t^\top z}\bigr]
     =\mathbb E\bigl[e^{\,t^\top(\mu+\Sigma\epsilon)}\bigr]
     =e^{\,t^\top\mu}\;\mathbb E\bigl[e^{\,(t^\top\Sigma)\epsilon}\bigr]
     =e^{\,t^\top\mu}\;\exp\!\Bigl(\tfrac12\,(t^\top\Sigma)(t^\top\Sigma)^\top\Bigr).
\]

   But \((t^\top\Sigma)(t^\top\Sigma)^\top=t^\top\,\Sigma^2\,t\) and \(\Sigma^2=\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2)\).  Hence

   $$
     M_z(t)
     =\exp\!\Bigl(t^\top\mu+\tfrac12\,t^\top\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2)\,t\Bigr),
   $$

   which is _precisely_ the MGF of \(\mathcal N(\mu,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2))\).  By uniqueness of MGFs,  

   $$
     z\;\sim\;\mathcal N\bigl(\mu,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2)\bigr).
   $$

Conclusion: drawing 

$$
z_k\;\sim\;\mathcal N\bigl(\mu_\phi(y_k),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\phi(y_k)^2)\bigr)
$$ 

_at_ the sampling step is mathematically equivalent to writing 

$$
z_k=\mu_\phi(y_k)+\sigma_\phi(y_k)\odot\epsilon_k,
\quad
\epsilon_k\sim\mathcal N(0,I),
$$ 

since both constructions produce the same Gaussian law for \(z_k\).

## VAE Architecture 4 - Decoder

For the decoder, it appears we have a neural network which models  $p_\theta(y\mid z)=\mathcal N(y;\,\mu_\theta(z),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{\theta}^2(z)))$. The input to this neural network is $z_k$ and the output are the Gaussian parameters $\mu_{\theta}(z_k)$ and $\sigma_{\theta}(z_k)$. The reconstruction $\tilde{y}_k$ is drawn from this Gaussian distribution.

**Answer**

Yes, that’s exactly the usual Gaussian‐decoder VAE.  Concretely:

1 **Decoder network**
   You have a deterministic neural network  

\[
     z\;\longmapsto\;\bigl(\mu_\theta(z),\,\sigma_\theta(z)\bigr)
     \;\in\;\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R^n_{>0},
\]

   parameterized by \(\theta\).  Here \(\mu_\theta(z)\) and \(\sigma_\theta(z)\) are the per-coordinate means and standard deviations of your Gaussian likelihood.

2 **Likelihood**
   Given a latent \(z_k\), you define

\[
     p_\theta\bigl(y\mid z_k\bigr)
     =\mathcal N\!\bigl(y\;;\;\mu_\theta(z_k),\;\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\theta(z_k)^2)\bigr).
\]

3 **Reconstruction sample**
   To generate (or “reconstruct”) a sample \(\tilde y_k\) from the decoder you draw

   $$
     \tilde y_k
     \;=\;\mu_\theta(z_k)\;+\;\sigma_\theta(z_k)\odot\epsilon,
     \qquad
     \epsilon\sim\mathcal N(0,I_n).
   $$

   Equivalently,

   $$
     \tilde y_k\;\sim\;\mathcal N\!\bigl(\mu_\theta(z_k),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\theta(z_k)^2)\bigr).
   $$

4 **ELBO term**
   In practice, when computing the reconstruction term of the ELBO you don’t need to draw \(\tilde y_k\) explicitly.  You compute

\[
     \mathbb E_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\Bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\Bigr]
     \;\approx\;
     \frac1L\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}
     \log \mathcal N\!\bigl(y_k\;;\;\mu_\theta(z_k^{(\ell)}),\,\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_\theta(z_k^{(\ell)})^2)\bigr)
\]

   using samples \(z_k^{(\ell)}\) from \(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\).  For a single sample the Gaussian log-density is

\[
     \log p_\theta(y_k\mid z_k)
     =-\frac12\sum_{i=1}^n\Bigl[
       \tfrac{\bigl(y_{k,i}-\mu_{\theta,i}(z_k)\bigr)^2}{\sigma_{\theta,i}(z_k)^2}
       +\log\bigl(2\pi\,\sigma_{\theta,i}(z_k)^2\bigr)
     \Bigr].
\]

So yes: the decoder takes \(z_k\) as input, outputs \(\mu_\theta(z_k)\) and \(\sigma_\theta(z_k)\), and then the reconstruction \(\tilde y_k\) is sampled from that Gaussian.

## Training

Now that we have clarified the architecture of the VAE, let’s discuss the details of the training. The observation index $k = 1, \cdots, m$. There are $m$ observations. $y_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  What is the objective function for training? Clearly there must be a term to minimize the reconstruction error $(y_k - \tilde{y}_k)$. The training phase must result in fixing of the parameters $\phi$ and $\theta$ of the encoder and decoder networks. Explain the details of training.

**Answer**

The training objective of a VAE is to maximize, over your encoder‐parameters \(\phi\) and decoder‐parameters \(\theta\), the (empirical) Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) on the log‐likelihood of your \(m\) data points \(\{y_k\}_{k=1}^m\).  Equivalently one minimizes the _negative_ ELBO, which decomposes into a reconstruction term plus a regularizing KL term.  Concretely:

1.  **Definition of the ELBO for a single datum**
    For each observation \(y_k\), the ELBO is

    \[
      \mathcal L(\theta,\phi;\,y_k)
      \;=\;
      \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{z\sim q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}
           \bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\bigr]}_{\displaystyle\text{(a) reconstruction}} 
      \;-\;
      \underbrace{D_{\rm KL}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\|\,p(z)\bigr)}_
        {\displaystyle\text{(b) regularizer}}.
    \]

    Here  
    (a) \(\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi}[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)]\) encourages the decoder to place high likelihood on \(y_k\),  
    (b) \(D_{\rm KL}(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\|\,p(z))\) pushes the approximate posterior toward the prior \(p(z)=\mathbb{N}(0,I)\).

2.  **Empirical objective over the dataset**
    Replace the population expectation by the empirical average over \(k=1,\dots,m\).  The total ELBO is

    \[
      \mathcal L_{\rm total}(\theta,\phi)
      = \sum_{k=1}^m \mathcal L(\theta,\phi;\,y_k)
      \;=\;
      \sum_{k=1}^m
      \Bigl\{
      \mathcal{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\bigr]
      \;-\;
      D_{\rm KL}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\|\,p(z)\bigr)
      \Bigr\}.
    \]

    In practice we _maximize_ \(\mathcal L_{\rm total}\), or equivalently _minimize_ the loss

    \[
      \mathcal J(\theta,\phi)
      = -\,\mathcal L_{\rm total}(\theta,\phi).
    \]

3.  **Writing out the two terms**
    3.1 Reconstruction term  
    If you use a Gaussian decoder  

    \[
      p_\theta(y\mid z)
      = \mathbb{N}\!\bigl(y;\,\mu_\theta(z),\,\text{diag}(\sigma_\theta(z)^2)\bigr),
    \]

    then
    
    \[
      \log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)
      = -\frac12\sum_{i=1}^n
        \Bigl[\tfrac{(y_{k,i}-\mu_{\theta,i}(z))^2}{\sigma_{\theta,i}(z)^2}
              +\log\bigl(2\pi\,\sigma_{\theta,i}(z)^2\bigr)
        \Bigr].
    \]

    In many implementations one further _fixes_ \(\sigma_{\theta,i}(z)=1\), so that
    \(\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\propto -\tfrac12\|y_k-\mu_\theta(z)\|^2\), i.e.\ a mean‐squared error.

    3.2 KL‐divergence term  
    Since

    \[
      q_\phi(z\mid y_k)
      = \mathbb{N}\!\bigl(z;\,\mu_\phi(y_k),\,\text{diag}(\sigma_\phi(y_k)^2)\bigr),
      \quad
      p(z)=\mathbb{N}(0,I),
    \]

    one has the closed‐form

    \[
      D_{\rm KL}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\|\,p(z)\bigr)
      = \frac12\sum_{j=1}^d
        \bigl[\sigma_{\phi,j}(y_k)^2
              +\mu_{\phi,j}(y_k)^2
              -1
              -\log\sigma_{\phi,j}(y_k)^2
        \bigr].
    \]

4.  **Stochastic optimization via mini‐batches**
    You typically do not compute the full sum over \(k=1,\dots,m\) at each step.  Instead you sample a mini‐batch \(\{y_{k_1},\dots,y_{k_B}\}\) of size \(B\), and approximate the ELBO by

    \[
      \widehat{\mathcal L}_{\rm batch}
      = \frac1B\sum_{b=1}^B
      \Bigl\{
        \log p_\theta\bigl(y_{k_b}\mid z_{k_b}\bigr)
        \;-\;
        D_{\rm KL}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y_{k_b})\|\;p(z)\bigr)
      \Bigr\},
    \]

    where each \(z_{k_b}\) is drawn _via_ the reparameterization

    \[
      z_{k_b}   = \mu_\phi\bigl(y_{k_b}\bigr) + \sigma_\phi\bigl(y_{k_b}\bigr)\odot \epsilon,\quad
      \epsilon\sim\mathbb{N}(0,I_d).
    \]

    You then take one (or several) gradient steps

    \[
      \phi\;\leftarrow\;\phi + \alpha\,\nabla_\phi\,\widehat{\mathcal L}_{\rm batch},
      \qquad
      \theta\;\leftarrow\;\theta + \alpha\,\nabla_\theta\,\widehat{\mathcal L}_{\rm batch},
    \]

    using, e.g., the Adam optimizer with learning rate \(\alpha\).

5   **Summary of the training loop**

For \(t=1,\dots,T\) (number of gradient steps):

 a) Sample a mini‐batch \(\{y_{k_b}\}_{b=1}^B\).  
 b) For each \(y_{k_b}\) compute \(\mu_\phi(y_{k_b})\), \(\sigma_\phi(y_{k_b})\).  
 c) Sample \(\epsilon_b\sim\mathbb{N}(0,I_d)\), set  

\[
            z_{k_b}=\mu_\phi(y_{k_b})+\sigma_\phi(y_{k_b}) \odot\epsilon_b.
\]


 d) Decode: compute \(\mu_\theta(z_{k_b})\), \(\sigma_\theta(z_{k_b})\) and then  
       \(\log p_\theta(y_{k_b}\mid z_{k_b})\).  
 e) Compute the batch ELBO \(\widehat{\mathcal L}_{\rm batch}\) and its gradients w.r.t.\ \(\phi,\theta\).  
 f) Update \(\phi,\theta\) by a gradient‐based optimizer.

After convergence, you have fixed the encoder parameters \(\phi\) and decoder parameters \(\theta\).  At test time you can (i) encode any new \(y\) to \(q_\phi(z\mid y)\), (ii) sample \(z\sim p(z)\) and decode to generate new data via \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\).


## Training 2

In the summary above, you introduced $t = 1, \cdots, T$. What is this?

**Answer**

Here, \(t\) simply indexes the training _iterations_ (or “steps”) of your stochastic optimization loop.  Concretely:

- You run a loop of \(T\) total gradient‐update steps.  
- At each step \(t=1,2,\dots,T\), you  
  1. sample a mini-batch of data,  
  2. compute the stochastic estimate of the ELBO,  
  3. compute its gradients w.r.t.\ \(\phi,\theta\), and  
  4. take a gradient step to update \(\phi,\theta\).  

Thus  

\[
t=1,\dots,T
\]

labels each of these updates, and \(T\) is the total number of such mini-batch update steps you choose to perform.

## Reconstruction term in ELBO

I need clarification on the reconstruction term in ELBO. Reconstruction should mean that given $y_k$, the VAE generates an estimate $\tilde{y}_k$ such that the difference is small in some measure. How does this idea translate to the reconstruction term used in ELBO. Explain in a step by step manner.

**Answer**

Below is a step-by-step account of how the intuitive notion of “reconstruction error”  

\[
\|y_k - \tilde y_k\|
\]

is embedded into the ELBO’s reconstruction term  
\(\displaystyle \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)]\).

1  **Choose a probabilistic decoder \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\)**
    Rather than producing a single point estimate \(\tilde y_k\), the decoder outputs a probability density over possible reconstructions.  A common choice for real-valued data is  

  $$
      p_\theta(y\mid z)
      =\mathcal{N}\!\bigl(y;\,\mu_\theta(z),\,\sigma^2 I\bigr),
  $$

  where \(\mu_\theta(z)\in\mathbb{R}^n\) is the decoder’s mean and \(\sigma^2\) is a (fixed or learned) variance.

2  **Log-likelihood as “negative reconstruction error”**
    For a Gaussian likelihood the log-density of observing \(y_k\) given \(z\) is

  $$
      \log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)
      = -\,\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,\bigl\|y_k - \mu_\theta(z)\bigr\|^2
        \;-\;\frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma^2).
  $$
    Up to the additive constant \(-\tfrac{n}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma^2)\), this is exactly \(-\tfrac1{2\sigma^2}\) times the squared error between \(y_k\) and the reconstruction mean \(\mu_\theta(z)\).

3  **Incorporating the encoder uncertainty**
    The VAE does not pick a single \(z\) but rather a distribution \(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\).  Hence we take the expectation of the log-likelihood under \(z\sim q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\):

$$
  \mathbb{E}_{z\sim q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\!\bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\bigr]  = 
  -\,\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,
  \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi}\!\bigl[\|y_k-\mu_\theta(z)\|^2\bigr]
  \;+\;\text{constant}.
$$

  Maximizing this term forces the decoder’s mean \(\mu_\theta(z)\) (averaged over plausible \(z\) values) to lie close to the true \(y_k\).

4  **Monte-Carlo approximation**
    In practice we approximate the expectation by drawing one (or a few) samples 

  $$
      z_k = \mu_\phi(y_k)+\sigma_\phi(y_k)\odot\epsilon,
      \quad
      \epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I),
  $$

  and computing

  $$
      \log p_\theta(y_k\mid z_k)
      \;\approx\;
      -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,\bigl\|y_k-\mu_\theta(z_k)\bigr\|^2
      \;+\;\text{const}.
  $$

5  **ELBO reconstruction term**
    Putting it all together, the reconstruction part of the ELBO for datum \(k\) is

$$
      \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\bigr]
      \;\approx\;
      -\,\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\,
      \|y_k - \mu_\theta(z_k)\|^2
      \;+\;\text{const}.
$$

   Thus **maximizing** this expectation is equivalent (up to constants) to **minimizing** the expected squared error     \(\|y_k-\mu_\theta(z)\|^2\)—i.e.\ the usual reconstruction loss.

6  **Summary**
  - The decoder’s density \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\) turns point-wise reconstruction into a log-likelihood.  
  - For Gaussian \(p_\theta\), \(\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\) is (negative) MSE plus a constant.  
  - Taking \(\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\) yields an average reconstruction error weighted by how likely each \(z\) is under the encoder.  
  - Maximizing this term in the ELBO drives \(\mu_\theta(z)\) to match \(y_k\), exactly implementing the intuitive “reconstruction error” objective.


## Regularization term in ELBO

  Explain the intuition behind the regularization term in ELBO.

  **Answer**

The ELBO for one data point \(y_k\) can be written as  

\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi; y_k)
=
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}\bigl[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z)\bigr]}_{\displaystyle\text{(reconstruction)}} 
\;-\;
\underbrace{D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\big\|\,p(z)\bigr)}_{\displaystyle\text{(regularizer)}}.
\]  

You already saw that the first term rewards accurate reconstructions.  We now build intuition for the second term  

\[
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\big\|\,p(z)\bigr)
=\int q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\,\log\frac{q_\phi(z\mid y_k)}{p(z)}\,dz.
\]

1.  Preventing “over‐powerful” encodings  
   If we only maximized reconstruction, the encoder could drive \(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\) to a Dirac delta at some \(z\) that decodes perfectly to \(y_k\).  That would give zero reconstruction error but completely “overfit” each \(y_k\) (and destroy any ability to sample new \(z\sim p(z)\)).  The KL term penalizes deviation of \(q_\phi\) from the prior \(p(z)\), blocking this collapse.

2.  Encouraging a “smooth,” compressive code  
   The KL measures how many “nats” (or bits) of information the approximate posterior carries beyond the prior.  
     • If \(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\approx p(z)\), then \(D_{\mathrm{KL}}\approx0\): the code for \(y_k\) is very compact (almost no information over the prior).  
     • If \(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\) sharpens far away from \(p(z)\), the KL grows, penalizing your objective.  
   Thus you trade off fidelity (reconstruction) versus compression (staying close to \(p(z)\)).

3.  Making generation from \(p(z)\) meaningful  
   After training, you want to sample \(z\sim p(z)\) and decode via \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\).  If during training the posterior encodings \(q_\phi(z\mid y)\) wandered far from \(p(z)\), then samples from \(p(z)\) would lie in regions the decoder never saw—leading to garbage outputs.  The KL term aligns the bulk of \(q_\phi(z\mid y)\) with \(p(z)\), so that “random” \(z\sim p(z)\) produce sensible \(y\).

4.  Interpreting as a regularizer  
   In machine‐learning terms, \(D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q\|p)\) is a complexity penalty on the encoder.  If you view \(q_\phi(z\mid y_k)\) as a variational approximation with free parameters \(\phi\), the KL term is the analog of an \(\ell_2\)-penalty on those parameters—inhibiting them from drifting arbitrarily far from a reference distribution \(p(z)\).

5.  Rate–Distortion perspective  
   The VAE objective exactly mirrors the classical _rate–distortion_ trade‐off:  
     – Distortion \(\equiv\) expected reconstruction loss \(\mathbb{E}[-\log p_\theta(y\mid z)]\).  
     – Rate \(\equiv\) KL divergence \(D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_\phi(z\mid y)\|p(z))\).  
   By tuning this trade‐off, you decide how much information about \(y\) the latent code \(z\) is allowed to carry.

In practice, you cannot drive the KL term to zero without wrecking reconstruction, nor can you drive it to huge values without overfitting.  The optimum balances the two, yielding latent representations that are both informative about each \(y_k\) and yet remain well‐aligned with the prior \(p(z)\).


## Inference pass

I will come back to the intuition for the KL term. During the inference forward pass phase, how does the VAE work? Certainly, new observations $y$ are the input. Then what?

**Answer**

At inference time (i.e. after you have finished training and fixed \(\phi,\theta\)), the VAE acts as a fast “encoder→latent→optional decoder” pipeline.  Concretely, given a new observation \(y\in\Bbb R^n\):

1 **Encode \(y\) to an approximate posterior**

You pass \(y\) through the encoder network and compute  

\[
     (\mu,\sigma)
     \;=\;
     \bigl(\mu_{\phi}(y),\,\sigma_{\phi}(y)\bigr),
     \quad
     q_{\phi}(z\mid y)
     =\mathcal{N}\!\bigl(z;\,\mu,\;\mathrm{diag}(\sigma^2)\bigr).
\]

2 **Obtain a latent code \(z\), You have two main choices:**

(a) **Deterministic embedding**: use the posterior mean  

\[
         z = \mu_{\phi}(y).
\]  

  This gives a single “best‐guess” embedding of \(y\).  
(b) **Stochastic sample**: draw  

\[
         z = \mu_{\phi}(y)\;+\;\sigma_{\phi}(y)\odot\epsilon,
         \quad
         \epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_d).
\]  

  This reflects the encoder’s uncertainty in the latent representation.

3 **(Optional) Reconstruct \(y\)**
   If you wish to see how well the model “reconstructs” \(y\), you pass \(z\) through the decoder network:  

\[
     (\tilde\mu,\tilde\sigma)
     = \bigl(\mu_{\theta}(z),\,\sigma_{\theta}(z)\bigr),
     \quad
     p_{\theta}(y\mid z)
     =\mathcal{N}(y;\,\tilde\mu,\text{diag}(\tilde\sigma^2)).
\]

   Again you may either take \(\tilde y = \tilde\mu\) as the point reconstruction, or sample  
   \(\tilde y \sim \mathcal{N}(\tilde\mu,\text{diag}(\tilde\sigma^2))\).

4 **Use of the latent code**
   Once you have \(z\), you can  
   • Feed it into downstream tasks (classification, clustering, regression),  
   • Interpolate in latent space between different \(z\)s and decode back to data‐space,  
   • Visualize or otherwise analyze the low‐dimensional manifold captured by the encoder.

Because the encoder and decoder are just feed‐forward neural networks at this point, each new \(y\) is processed in a single forward pass through the encoder (and optionally through the decoder), with no further gradient updates.


## Joint Distribution of $y$

Since $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents a realization of the data generating process, each entry of $y$, that is, $y^{(i)}, i = 1, \cdots, n$ can be viewed as a random variable. After the VAE has been trained, it can be used to model the joint distribution of the $y^{(i)}$. Is this correct?

**Answer**

Yes — once the VAE is trained, you have in hand a full probabilistic model of the random vector 

\[
Y=(Y^{(1)},\dots,Y^{(n)})\in\mathbb{R}^n
\]  

via the decoder \(p_\theta(y\mid z)\) together with the prior \(p(z)\).  Concretely you define the model’s _marginal_ (joint) density on \(Y\) by  

$$
p_\theta(y)
=\int p(z)\,p_\theta(y\mid z)\,\mathrm{d}z
\;=\;
\int \mathcal N\bigl(z;0,I_d\bigr)\,
       \mathcal N\bigl(y;\mu_\theta(z),\text{diag}(\sigma_\theta(z)^2)\bigr)
       \,\mathrm{d}z.
$$  

This \(p_\theta(y)\) is your learned approximation to the true data‐generating joint density of \(\{Y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^n\).  

1  **Conditional independence structure**
  Note that in the Gaussian‐decoder VAE we assume  
  $$
      p_\theta(y\mid z)
      =\prod_{i=1}^n
        \mathcal N\bigl(y^{(i)};\,\mu_{\theta,i}(z),\,\sigma_{\theta,i}(z)^2\bigr).
  $$  
  Hence the coordinates \(Y^{(1)},\dots,Y^{(n)}\) are _conditionally_ independent given \(Z\), but they are _marginally_ dependent because they all couple through the latent \(Z\).

2  **Sampling from the joint**
  To generate a joint sample \(\tilde y\sim p_\theta(y)\):  
    a) draw \(z\sim p(z)=\mathcal N(0,I_d)\),  
    b) draw \(\tilde y\sim p_\theta(y\mid z)\).  
  You thus obtain one sample of the full vector \((\tilde y^{(1)},\dots,\tilde y^{(n)})\).

3  **Density evaluation**
  Although the integral  
  \(\;p_\theta(y)=\int p(z)\,p_\theta(y\mid z)\,dz\)  
  is not available in closed form, you can _approximate_ it (for instance via importance sampling or other Monte Carlo methods) if you need to evaluate the joint density of a given \(y\).

4  **Approximation caveats**
  – The true data‐generating joint density \(p_{\rm data}(y)\) may lie _outside_ your model family \(\{p_\theta\}\).  Thus \(p_\theta(y)\) is in general only an _approximation_, the quality of which depends on network capacity and optimization.  
  – Because we optimized an ELBO (a lower bound on \(\log p_\theta(y)\)), the learned \(\theta\) maximizes that bound, not the exact likelihood.  Still, in practice this often gives a very good fit to the joint.

In summary, after training your VAE defines a generative model 

\[
Y\;\sim\;p_\theta(y)
\;=\;
\int p(z)\,p_\theta(y\mid z)\,dz,
\]  

which _is_ a model of the joint distribution of the entries \(Y^{(1)},\dots,Y^{(n)}\).

## ELBO derived

You have provided the intuition for ELBO. Now provide a formal derivation of ELBO.

**Answer**

Below is the standard “variational” derivation of the ELBO (Evidence Lower BOund) for a single datum \(y\).  All steps use only basic properties of logarithms, expectations, and Jensen’s inequality.

1  The marginal log‐likelihood  
We wish to evaluate (or maximize) the log‐evidence  

\[
\log p_{\theta}(y)
=\log\!\int p_{\theta}(y,z)\,dz
=\log\!\int p_{\theta}(y\mid z)\,p(z)\,dz.
\]

2  Introducing a variational distribution  
Fix an arbitrary distribution \(q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\) that has the same support as \(p(z\mid y)\).  Since \(\int q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\,dz=1\), we may write

\[
\log p_{\theta}(y)
=\log\!\int q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\,\frac{p_{\theta}(y,z)}{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\,dz
=\log\mathbb{E}_{z\sim q_{\phi}(\cdot\mid y)}
\biggl[\frac{p_{\theta}(y,z)}{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\biggr].
\]

3  Applying Jensen’s inequality  
Since \(\log\) is concave,  

\[
\log\mathbb{E}_{q}\bigl[X\bigr]
\;\ge\;
\mathbb{E}_{q}\bigl[\log X\bigr].
\]

Setting \(X = p_{\theta}(y,z)/q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\) gives the ELBO lower bound:

\[
\log p_{\theta}(y)
\;\ge\;
\mathbb{E}_{z\sim q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\!
\Bigl[\log p_{\theta}(y,z)\;-\;\log q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\Bigr]
\;=\;
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi;y).
\]

4  Decomposing \(\mathcal{L}\)  
Write

\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi;y)
=\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log p_{\theta}(y,z)\bigr]
\;-\;\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\bigr].
\]

Since \(\log p_{\theta}(y,z)=\log p_{\theta}(y\mid z)+\log p(z)\), we get

\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi;y)
=\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log p_{\theta}(y\mid z)\bigr]}_{\text{(A) reconstruction}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log p(z)\bigr]
-\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\bigr]}_{\text{(B) regularizer}}.
\]

But note that

\[
\mathbb{E}_{q}\bigl[\log p(z)\bigr]
-\mathbb{E}_{q}\bigl[\log q(z)\bigr]
=-\,D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\,\big\|\,p(z)\bigr).
\]

Thus the usual form

\[
\boxed{
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi;y)
=
\mathbb{E}_{z\sim q_{\phi}(z\mid y)}\bigl[\log p_{\theta}(y\mid z)\bigr]
\;-\;
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\!\bigl(q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\,\big\|\,p(z)\bigr)
}\,.
\]

5  Exact decomposition with the true posterior  
One can also write exactly (no Jensen)

\[
\log p_{\theta}(y)
=\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi;y)
\;+\;
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(q_{\phi}(z\mid y)\,\big\|\,p_{\theta}(z\mid y)\bigr),
\]

which shows \(\mathcal{L}\) is a lower bound since \(D_{\rm KL}\ge0\).

6  Extension to a dataset  
Given observations \(\{y_k\}_{k=1}^m\), assume they are i.i.d. under \(p_{\theta}\).  The total ELBO is

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{total}}(\theta,\phi)
=\sum_{k=1}^m
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi;y_k)
=\sum_{k=1}^m
\Bigl\{
\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z\mid y_k)}[\log p_{\theta}(y_k\mid z)]
\;-\;
D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi}(z\mid y_k)\,\|\,p(z))
\Bigr\}.
\]

We then maximize \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{total}}\) (or equivalently minimize its negative) w.r.t.\ \(\theta,\phi\).

This completes the formal derivation of the ELBO.

## Measurements $y_k$ are i.i.d

The VAE theory just discussed implicitly assumes that the observations are drawn i.i.d from the data generating process. Is this correct?

**Answer**

Yes.  In the derivation and training objective we in fact assume that the dataset 

\[
\{y_k\}_{k=1}^m
\]

consists of independent, identically distributed draws from the underlying data‐generating law.  Concretely:

1  Generative model factorization  
  We posit  

\[
      p_{\theta}(y_{1:m},z_{1:m})
      =\prod_{k=1}^m p(z_k)\,p_{\theta}(y_k\mid z_k),
\]

   which implies the marginal over the observations factorizes as 

\[
      p_{\theta}(y_{1:m})
      =\prod_{k=1}^m p_{\theta}(y_k).
\]

2  Variational posterior factorization  
    We choose an amortized variational family that likewise factorizes:  
    
\[
      q_{\phi}(z_{1:m}\mid y_{1:m})
      =\prod_{k=1}^m q_{\phi}(z_k\mid y_k).
\]

3  ELBO as a sum of per‐datum terms  
    Because of these factorizations, the total ELBO over the dataset decomposes into a sum of independent terms:  

\[
      \mathcal L_{\rm total}(\theta,\phi)
      = \sum_{k=1}^m
        \Bigl\{
          \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z_k\mid y_k)}[\log p_\theta(y_k\mid z_k)]
          \;-\;
          D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_\phi(z_k\mid y_k)\,\|\,p(z_k))
        \Bigr\}.
\]

Implicit in this decomposition is the assumption that each \(y_k\) is drawn i.i.d.\ from the same marginal \(p_\theta(y)\).

If your data are _not_ i.i.d.\ (for instance time‐series, spatial fields, graphs, etc.), you must replace this vanilla VAE by a model that encodes the dependencies—for example:  
• A sequential or recurrent VAE that conditions \(p(y_k\mid z_k)\) on past observations \(y_{<k}\).  
• A hierarchical or structured VAE that allows correlations among \(z_k\).  

But the standard VAE as derived above _does_ assume i.i.d.\ observations.
